This tutorial demonstrates how to generate text using a character-based RNN. You will work with a dataset of Shakespeare's writing from Andrej Karpathy's [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/). Given a sequence of characters from this data ("Shakespear"), train a model to predict the next character in the sequence ("e"). Longer sequences of text can be generated by calling the model repeatedly.

Note: Enable GPU acceleration to execute this notebook faster. In Colab: *Runtime > Change runtime type > Hardware accelerator > GPU*.

This tutorial includes runnable code implemented using [tf.keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/sequential_model) and [eager execution](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/eager). The following is the sample output when the model in this tutorial trained for 30 epochs, and started with the prompt "Q":
"""





"""<pre>
QUEENE:
I had thought thou hadst a Roman; for the oracle,
Thus by All bids the man against the word,
Which are so weak of care, by old care done;
Your children were in your holy love,
And the precipitation through the bleeding throne.

BISHOP OF ELY:
Marry, and will, my lord, to weep in such a one were prettiest;
Yet now I was adopted heir
Of the world's lamentable day,
To watch the next way with his father with his face?

ESCALUS:
The cause why then we are all resolved more sons.

VOLUMNIA:
O, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, it is no sin it should be dead,
And love and pale as any will to that word.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But how long have I heard the soul for this world,
And show his hands of life be proved to stand.

PETRUCHIO:
I say he look'd on, if I must be content
To stay him from the fatal of our country's bliss.
His lordship pluck'd from this sentence then for prey,
And then let us twain, being the moon,
were she such a case as fills m
</pre>

While some of the sentences are grammatical, most do not make sense. The model has not learned the meaning of words, but consider:

* The model is character-based. When training started, the model did not know how to spell an English word, or that words were even a unit of text.

* The structure of the output resembles a play—blocks of text generally begin with a speaker name, in all capital letters similar to the dataset.

* As demonstrated below, the model is trained on small batches of text (100 characters each), and is still able to generate a longer sequence of text with coherent structure.

Given a character, or a sequence of characters, what is the most probable next character? This is the task you're training the model to perform. The input to the model will be a sequence of characters, and you train the model to predict the output—the following character at each time step.

Since RNNs maintain an internal state that depends on the previously seen elements, given all the characters computed until this moment, what is the next character?

### Create training examples and targets

Next divide the text into example sequences. Each input sequence will contain `seq_length` characters from the text.

For each input sequence, the corresponding targets contain the same length of text, except shifted one character to the right.

So break the text into chunks of `seq_length+1`. For example, say `seq_length` is 4 and our text is "Hello". The input sequence would be "Hell", and the target sequence "ello".

To do this first use the `tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices` function to convert the text vector into a stream of character indices.

* `tf.keras.layers.GRU`: A type of RNN with size `units=rnn_units` (You can also use an LSTM layer here.)

The most important part of a custom training loop is the train step function.

Use `tf.GradientTape` to track the gradients. You can learn more about this approach by reading the [eager execution guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/eager).

1. Execute the model and calculate the loss under a `tf.GradientTape`.
