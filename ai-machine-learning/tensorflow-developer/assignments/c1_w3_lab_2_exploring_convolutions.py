# Ungraded Lab: Exploring Convolutions

In this lab, you will explore how convolutions work by creating a basic convolution on a 2D grayscale image. First, you will load the image by taking the [ascent](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.datasets.ascent.html) image from [SciPy](https://scipy.org/). It's a nice, built-in picture with lots of angles and lines.
"""

from scipy.datasets import ascent

# load the ascent image
ascent_image = ascent()

"""You can use the pyplot library to draw the image so you'll know what it looks like."""

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Visualize the image
plt.grid(False)
plt.gray()
plt.axis('off')
plt.imshow(ascent_image)
plt.show()

"""The image is stored as a numpy array so you can create the transformed image by first copying that array. You can also get the dimensions of the image so you can loop over it later."""

import numpy as np

# Copy image to a numpy array
image_transformed = np.copy(ascent_image)

# Get the dimensions of the image
size_x = image_transformed.shape[0]
size_y = image_transformed.shape[1]

"""Now you can create a filter as a 3x3 array."""

# Experiment with different values and see the effect
filter = [ [0, 1, 0], [1, -4, 1], [0, 1, 0]]

# A couple more filters to try for fun!
# filter = [ [-1, -2, -1], [0, 0, 0], [1, 2, 1]]
# filter = [ [-1, 0, 1], [-2, 0, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]

# If all the digits in the filter don't add up to 0 or 1, you
# should probably do a weight to get it to do so
# so, for example, if your weights are 1,1,1 1,2,1 1,1,1
# They add up to 10, so you would set a weight of .1 if you want to normalize them
weight  = 1

"""Now you can create a convolution. You will iterate over the image, leaving a 1 pixel margin, and multiplying each of the neighbors of the current pixel by the value defined in the filter (i.e. the current pixel's neighbor above it and to the left will be multiplied by the top left item in the filter, etc.)

You'll then multiply the result by the weight, and then ensure the result is in the range 0-255.

Finally you'll load the new value into the transformed image.

"""## Effect of Max Pooling

The next cell will show a (2, 2) pooling. The idea here is to iterate over the image, and look at the pixel and it's immediate neighbors to the right, beneath, and right-beneath. It will take the largest of them and load it into the new image. Thus, the new image will be 1/4 the size of the old -- with the dimensions on X and Y being halved by this process. You'll see that the features get maintained despite this compression!
